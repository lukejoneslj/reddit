politics,Megathread: House Votes to Impeach President Donald J. Trump,"I posted this as I watched it live in the Live Thread. In case anyone wasn’t able to watch the live debates this evening, Adam Schiff delivered the quote of this century which deserves its place in history. 


Adam Schiff waited patiently as John Ratcliffe delivered fire and brimstone against the Democrats, the Unfair Process, the Unnamed Whistleblower, and then cooly laid a fucking poetic sledgehammer and leveled every Republican response, in one line:

Rep John Ratcliffe, (R) Texas:   “History will remember this day as the day the Democrats impeached the president for nothing more than spite.”

Adam Schiff, (D) California;   **”Madam Speaker, I think when the history of this time is written, it will record that when my colleagues found they lacked the courage to stand up to this unethical president, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did.”**

Schiff is a uniquely gifted orator. These 39 words will be immortalized in history as one sentence which so brilliantly and concisely summarized the willing, blindful, repugnant actions of the GOP, offset by the Democrats trying to ballast our democracy by impeaching this dangerous and corrupt president.

**Edit**: Voting in 2018 made this happen. People were pissed, and disgusted, and exasperated, by the direction the country had gone under full republican control in *less than* 2 years. 

At that time I wasn’t sure if I was registered to vote, then listened to a podcast of Pod Save America (plugging them because I learn more from this podcast than any other on politics) they lead me to this link:

https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/

Folks, if you’re not sure if you are registered, or even if you are sure, just take the 30 seconds to confirm if you are registered to vote. And if you aren’t, well here ya go:

My original comment before I started pulling in more links:

They were running rampant in March/April/May. Google ""PPE theft kushner"", masks kushner, etc. This is why we don't see his dumb reptile face in front of the cameras anymore. How many died because they stole PPE from blue states and cities?

V O T E",6,"The text presents a series of news articles alleging wrongdoing by the Trump administration and Jared Kushner regarding PPE distribution. While the initial comment uses strong language like ""stole,"" ""dumb reptile face,"" and the rhetorical question ""How many died because they stole PPE...?"" suggesting an accusatory and negative tone with moderate hostility and some sarcasm. The inclusion of links to news articles and the final call to vote, however, does not in itself contain any hateful or harassing language. However, the overall tone and accusatory language, especially the insults, push the toxicity score up."
