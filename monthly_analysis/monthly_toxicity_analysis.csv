What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.""

TLDR: Author of the article, Jeffery Goldberg, Editor-in-Chief of The Atlantic, says several times that he will not quote certain information in the interests of safety of active agents and real-time intelligence info. From clips of the convo he did include, it appears that top-level people in the President's cabinet fracked up major. **Someone included** ***the editor in chief of The Atlantic*** **in an insecure online messaging discussion of the attack. And nobody noticed or questioned who ""JG"" was while they debated a military action.** 

How horrific is it that the editor in chief of The Atlantic is more aware of the need for cybersecurity and intelligence security than, well, *everyone* in the current administration?

Other subs just throw low effort posts that don’t live up the subreddit’s namesake. No, AOC and Bernie speaking at a rally is not a public freakout. 

Okay cool, I'll just filter out the subreddits so I dont come across them, right? Yeah until another astroturfed sub pops out of nowhere with a corny name like “AnythingGoesNews”. Either that or some town in Bumfuck, Ohio with a population of 5,000 has a post that says “Fuck Trump” hit the frontpage with 50k upvotes.

Alright fine, guess I’ll stick to the subs I’m subscribed to, mostly sports or hobby subs, and wont venture to Popular or r/all.

Oh wow, Ovi broke a goal-scoring record that was thought to be seemingly unbreakable. This is such a historic and once in a lifetime event. Surely there wont be anything political about this historic hockey achievement. *Reads comments.* “From one Russian asset to another”, “MAGAt vs Putin supporter”. Ffs

This site fucking blows now, but at least it’s helping me kick my addiction of compulsively using this app.",6,"The text expresses frustration and negativity towards the platform.

When I joined (different account than this one) it was very different. Ron Paul was the overwhelming favorite presidential candidate of the masses in 2012. However, U.S. politics didn't dominate every single corner of the website like it has since 2016.

There was also difference of opinion and nuance to discussions. However, a lot of the sub was sorta 4-Chan lite and political discussions had to be sought out.

I'd wager to guess that 80%-90% of the traffic on here is fake. More and more I'm convinced it's just bots arguing with each other. It's like a classic example of the dead internet theory.",4,"The text is critical of Reddit and suggests a negative shift in its user base and content.
